                    <p>
                        I got the opportunity to work at a Lexus dealership as an apprentice mechanic in their service shop.
                        During my 5 months at Lexus, I had the chance to familiarize myself with many pneumatic and power tools.
                        I also had the opportunity to learn a bit about accessibility in design. Many of the parts in a vehicle 
                        are placed in quite difficult areas to access, 
                        and this has been able to open my eye in some of the flaws in designing a car.
                        I aim to take my knowledge and design a car that is easier to repair than the current designs.
