                <h1>More about me</h1>
                <p> I am Brandon Choi from Richmond Hill, Ontario. 
                    I am passionate about becoming an engineer to one day be able to design a car. 
                    I am interested in motor racing, particularly Formula 1, 
                    and hope to work for a team in the future. 
                    I have skills in design projects, woodworking, 
                    CAD designing, CNC machining, and 3D printing, 
                    which complements my engineering pursuits. 
                    I also have experience as a mechanic apprentice at Lexus. 
                    Currently, I am an incoming student at the University of Waterloo, where 
                    I will be studying mechanical engineering.

                    <br>
                Apprentice Mechanic</h2>
                <p>
                    I got the opportunity to work at a Lexus dealership as an apprentice mechanic in their service shop. 
                    During my 5 months at Lexus, I had the chance to familiarize myself with many pneumatic and power tools. 
                    I also had the opportunity to learn a bit about accessibility in design. Many of the parts in a vehicle are placed in quite difficult areas to access, 
                    and this has opened my eyes to some of the flaws in designing a car. 
                    I aim to take my knowledge and design a car that is easier to repair than the current designs.
